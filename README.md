# Business-Analytics-Machine-learning-projects
 My humble attempts analyse and solve various business analytics problems with varying complexity using various Machine Learning algorithms. The analysis is performed in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files) and other notebooks. A working knowledge of Python is required to read through the scripts.

Below is the list of notebooks illustrating my projects:
1. [Retail product category predictions with Neural networks using tensorflow and Keras](https://github.com/remyaem/Business-Analytics-Machine-learning-projects/blob/master/Retail%20product%20category%20predictions%20with%20Neural%20networks.ipynb)
