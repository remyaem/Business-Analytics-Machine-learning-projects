# Business-Analytics-Machine-learning-projects
 My humble attempts analyse and solve various business analytics problems with varying complexity using various Machine Learning algorithms. The analysis is performed in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files) and other notebooks. A working knowledge of Python is required to read through the scripts.

Below is the list of notebooks illustrating my projects:
1. [Retail product category predictions with Neural networks using tensorflow and Keras](https://github.com/remyaem/Business-Analytics-Machine-learning-projects/blob/master/Retail%20product%20category%20predictions%20with%20Neural%20networks.ipynb)


****Install****

For Python

This repository requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

For TensorFlow and Keras

TensorFlow is a popular Deep Learning framework by Google, the installation instructions can be read [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). Similarly for Keras goto : [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution, which already has the above packages (including R) and more included. Make sure that Python 3.6 installer is selected.
