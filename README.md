# Business-Analytics-Machine-learning-projects
 My humble attempts analyse and solve various business analytics problems with varying complexity using various Machine Learning algorithms. The analysis is performed in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files) and other notebooks. A working knowledge of Python is required to read through the scripts.

Below is the list of notebooks illustrating my projects:
1. [Retail product category predictions with Neural networks using tensorflow and Keras](https://github.com/remyaem/Business-Analytics-Machine-learning-projects/blob/master/Retail%20product%20category%20predictions%20with%20Neural%20networks.ipynb)


## Install

### For Python

This repository requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### For TensorFlow and Keras

TensorFlow is a popular Deep Learning framework by Google, the installation instructions can be read [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). Similarly for Keras goto : [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution, which already has the above packages (including R) and more included. Make sure that Python 3.6 installer is selected.

## Code
Template code is provided in the .ipynb notebook files. You can jump to the notebooks clicking on the links in appropriate sections.

## Run
Download the required notebooks. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory(that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook notebookname.ipynb
or
jupyter notebook notebookname.ipynb

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## Data
The data files, as .csv, .txt, or .xls, may required to be downloaded through the source links provided in the notebook and be saved in the same directory as the notebook file.
